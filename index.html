				</div>
				<div class="content-container" id="how-to-play-container">
					<p class="display-text-large">The Objective</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						The game is played with two or more teams with two or
						more players per team. The objective of the game is for
						each team to correctly guess more cards than the
						other(s) over the course of three rounds.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						To correctly guess a card a team needs to successfully
						guess exactly what is written on the card based on a
						description from one of their team members. The rules
						for what the description may include vary by round.
					</p>
					<p class="display-text-large">The Cards</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						You may be wondering what is on these cards, and well,
						that is anything you choose as you make them up
						yourself! Anything from one word to a phrase or
						sentence. The longer and more obscure your cards are the
						more difficult they will be to guess!
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						All players will write a number of cards (which can be
						changed in the settings, the default is 3), which are
						then all added to the game pool and used for all teams
						to play with over the course of the three rounds. The
						card order is completely random and no one will know who
						wrote which card.
					</p>
					<p class="display-text-large">The Game</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						Each turn one player from the team will be the one
						required to describe the cards to their teammates in
						order for them to correctly guess what is written on the
						card.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						Each turn a team has one minute to guess as many cards
						as possible. If a card is correctly guessed the card is
						removed from the game for the rest of the round, once
						all cards have been correctly guessed the round is over,
						the amount of correctly guessed cards is added to each
						team's total score and the game moves to the next round
						where all the cards are added back to the game and used
						to play again.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						The player describing may skip a card if they choose to,
						however as a consequence they will lose a life. Each
						player has two lives per round. If a player breaks the
						description rules for the round they will also be
						required to skip their current card and as a reult lose
						a life. Skipped cards are not removed from play and will
						stay in the round until correctly guessed.
					</p>
					<p class="display-text-large">The Rounds</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						The game is played over three rounds, each round has
						its own rules on how the player describing the cards
						may describe them to the other player(s) on their team.
						The rules for each round get progressively more
						difficult however because the same cards are used for
						each round the players should also become more familiar
						with the cards in the pool over every round.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						<strong>Round One:</strong> The player can describe the
						card however they like without using any words on the
						card. They may not use 'rhymes with' or 'sounds like'
						descriptions for words.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						<strong>Round Two:</strong> The player can describe the
						card using only one word, the word may not be any word
						on the card and once they have said their desired word
						they may not say anything else or make any sounds until
						the card has been correctly guessed, or skipped.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						<strong>Round Three:</strong> The player can act out the
						card using any actions but may not say anything or use
						any sounds.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						If any rule for the round is broken the card must be
						skipped and the player will lose a life.
					</p>
					<p class="display-text-large">Ending The Game</p>
					<p class="paragraph-text">
						At the end of the third round each team's score over
						the course of the three rounds are added together to
						decide an overall winner.
