### How To Play

Kyle's Game is a party game typically played with paper and pen with at least two teams of ideally 3 to 5 players on each team. It involves a whole lot of fun and creativity and players have to make the cards that are played with.

#### The Objective

The game is played with two or more teams with two or more players per team. The objective of the game is for each team to correctly guess more cards than the other(s) over the course of three rounds.

To correctly guess a card a team needs to successfully guess exactly what is written on the card based on a description from one of their team members. The rules for what the description may include vary by round.

#### The Cards

You may be wondering what is on these cards, and well, that is anything you choose as you make them up yourself! Anything from one word to a phrase or sentence. The longer and more obscure your cards are the more difficult they will be to guess!

All players will write a number of cards (which can be changed in the settings, the default is 3), which are then all added to the game pool and used for all teams to play with over the course of the three rounds. The card order is completely random and no one will know who wrote which card.

#### The Game

Each turn one player from the team will be the one required to describe the cards to their team mates in order for them to correctly guess what is written on the card.

Each turn a team has one minute to guess as many cards as possible. If a card is correctly guessed the card is removed from the game for the rest of the round, once all cards have been correctly guessed the round is over, the amount of correctly guessed cards is added to each team's total score and the game moves to the next round where all the cards are added back to the game and used to play again.

The player describing may skip a card if they choose to, however as a consequence they will lose a life. Each player has two lives per round. If a player breaks the description rules for the round they will also be required to skip their current card and as a reult lose a life. Skipped cards are not removed from play and will stay in the round until correctly guessed.

#### The Rounds

The game is played over three rounds, each round has it's own rules on how the player describing the cards may describe them to the other player(s) on their team. The rules for each round get progressively more difficult however because the same cards are used for each round the players should also become more familiar with the cards in the pool over every round.

Round One: The player can describe the card however they like without using any words on the card. They may not use 'rhymes with' or 'sounds like' descriptions for words.

Round Two: The player can describe the card using only one word, the word may not be any word on the card and once they have said their desired word they may not say anything else or make any sounds until the card has been correctly guessed, or skipped.

Round Three: The player can act out the card using any actions but may not say anything or use any sounds.

If any rule for the round is broken the card must be skipped and the player will lose a life.

#### Ending The Game

At the end of the third round the each team's score over the course of the three rounds are added together to decide an overall winner.
