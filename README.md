### About The Game

Kyle's Game is a party game typically played with paper and pen with at least two teams of ideally 3 to 5 players on each team. It involves a whole lot of fun and creativity and players have to make the cards that are played with.

Basically the game involves players in team working together to guess what is says on the random cards players have made up. The game is played over three rounds, each with their own rules as how the person with the card may describe the card to players in their team.

Here's how the game works:

-   Players split into two to three teams of equal (or nearly equal) number of players.

-   Each player creates phrase cards, typically three but can be more for greater difficulty. These 'phrase' cards can be really anything you want, the other players are going to have to guess what they say word for word in the first round. They can be a word, phrase or senetence. The longer and more obtruse they are the more difficult they will be to guess. They can be a famous saying, song lyrics, something the other players may know word for word or completely made up.

-   All these cards are collected together and shuffled.

-   ROUND ONE
